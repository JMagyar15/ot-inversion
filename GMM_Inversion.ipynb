    "# Gaussian Mixture Model Inversion Using Optimal Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will consider the problem of fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by varying its parameters to optimise the Wasserstein distance between it and its target. GMMs are of interest as there exists a simple, closed form analytical solution for the 2-Wasserstein distance between Gaussian distributions of any dimension. Firstly, consider the following two mass distributions.\n",
